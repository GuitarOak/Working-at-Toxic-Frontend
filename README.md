## Notes from me
I would estimate that this would take ME roughly 8 hours to complete this project.
## 1st hour
I have a clear view of how the complete website should look and how to structure the tv series.
Although, I am Struggling with extracting data from JSON, haven't touched .json, APIs etc since I studied at my last
program in 2019.
## 2nd hour
Doing good, much progress quite fast after figuring the JSON stuff out.
Focusing on functionality > looks
## 3rd hour
Search function is a struggle
