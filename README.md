# Pre-interview assignment

## System description
This is an online library over popular TV shows. In the library, the user want to be able to list all th shows with cover and title, when the user hovers over a show, they will see the rating of the show (avarge vote). You should be able to find a show given a title or language, and list the shows by latest air date.
When the user clicks on a show, a new page with detailed information about the selected show will appear.

3. run the command 'node app.js'
4. Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser

## Notes from me
I would estimate that this would take ME roughly 8 hours to complete this project.

I would've loved to use React for this project but since I've only seen a "how to install React" video I chose 
to use node + express with express handlebars for this project.
## 1st hour
I have a clear view of how the complete website should look and how to structure the tv series.
Although, I am Struggling with extracting data from JSON, haven't touched .json, APIs etc since I studied at my last
program in 2019.
## 2nd hour
Doing good, much progress quite fast after figuring the JSON stuff out.
Focusing on functionality > looks
## 3rd hour
Search function is a struggle
## 4th hour
Finally got search function for title working, this was my first time implementing a search so I
did atleast get it working :)
## 5th hour
Only spent on css and making sure the code is uniform and clean

## Future Developments
* Improve the search function, right now you can only search for series title and it is case sensitive.
* Overall design improvements, e.g the series cards can be improved a lot.
* Links to where you can stream each series
